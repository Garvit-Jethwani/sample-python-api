### Test Scenario Outline

Given that the function under test is `get`, which retrieves a book by its ID and uses `find_one` to query a book database:
- The database is represented by a variable `books_db`, where each book record is a dictionary containing at least the key `"id"`.
- The function returns the matching book if it exists, otherwise returns a tuple `("Not found", 404)` for non-existing IDs.

Here are the test scenarios for this function:

---

**Scenario 1: Book Exists**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_existing_book
  Description: Validates that the function correctly returns the book detail when the provided ID matches an entry in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate `books_db` with predefined data including a book with a known ID.
  Act: Call `get` method with the ID of the book that exists.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the expected book data.
Validation:
  The success of this test ensures the function's ability to retrieve correct book entries from the database, aligning with its primary business logic.

---

**Scenario 2: Book Does Not Exist**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_nonexistent_book
  Description: Ensures that the function returns an appropriate error response when no book matches the given ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate `books_db` with predefined data, ensuring no book has the test ID.
  Act: Call `get` method with a non-existent book ID.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `("Not found", 404)`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function properly handles queries for non-existent books, providing correct HTTP status and message which is crucial for client error handling.

---

**Scenario 3: Empty Database**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_empty_database
  Description: Tests the function's response when `books_db` is empty, ensuring it still returns not found for any ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure `books_db` is empty.
  Act: Invoke the `get` with any ID.
  Assert: Check that the response is `("Not found", 404)`.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the resilience of the function when faced with an empty database, which is vital for maintaining robust behavior under varying database states.

---

**Scenario 4: Multiple Entries With Same ID**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_duplicate_ids
  Description: Validates that the function correctly handles cases where multiple entries have the same ID, choosing the first matching entry.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate `books_db` with multiple books with the same ID but different other details.
  Act: Call `get` with the duplicated ID.
  Assert: Check the function returns the first book with the specified ID.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function is deterministic in cases of data anomaly (duplicate IDs), which is essential for consistent application behavior.

---

These scenarios comprehensively cover the expected functionalities and boundary conditions of the `get` function within the domain of book retrieval in a simulated database environment.
